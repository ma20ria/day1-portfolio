            I currently serve as a placement coordinator in the Placement Cell, where I’ve successfully coordinated recruitment processes for many companies, ensuring seamless communication between recruiters and students. I also had the opportunity to organize a talk session by CareStack, offering insights into career opportunities and industry trends.

            I have been a class representative for multiple semesters and continue to hold this position, demonstrating my leadership and organizational skills. Beyond academics, I actively engage in various college activities, striving to balance my professional, academic, and extracurricular responsibilities.
